## Photography, travel and small stories

Photography is the way I slow down and pay attention to small details. I enjoy shooting cities, travel moments and everyday scenes that usually go unnoticed, and later using those images to remember where I’ve been and who I was with.

Most of my photos are connected to travelling: new cities, different cultures and people I meet along the way. Every trip ends up being a mix of walking around with the camera, visiting museums and learning how people live and think in that place. It’s a very visual way of learning, and it influences how I understand both technology and the problems I want to work on.

You can see a selection of my work in my photo portfolio, where I mix travel, portraits and more experimental shots: [Photo portfolio](https://tu-photo-portfolio-url.com).

## Music: the flute

Music has been around for years in my life, and the flute is the instrument I feel most connected to. Playing forces me to focus, listen carefully and follow a rhythm that has nothing to do with code or exams.

Even when I’m not in a regular ensemble, practising is a good way to disconnect and keep a different kind of discipline.

## Sports along the way

I’ve never really stayed with just one sport. Over time I’ve tried karate, swimming, archery, handball and basketball. Some lasted longer than others, but each one taught me something different about coordination, focus and teamwork.

For me the goal isn’t performance, it’s staying active and having fun. Switching sports from time to time is also a nice way to meet new people and avoid getting stuck in the same routine.

## Why these hobbies matter

All of this —photography, travel, music and sports— ends up influencing how I work and how I approach projects. It reminds me that, behind every technical decision, there are real people, contexts and stories.

That balance between technical and creative sides is exactly what I try to reflect in my portfolio and in the teams and projects I’m part of.
