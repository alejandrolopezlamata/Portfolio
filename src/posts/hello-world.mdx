## How it all started

At the beginning of 2025 I wanted a place to bring together my biomedical engineering projects, photography and a few side experiments in 3D and web. Instead of using a simple template, I decided to build a site where I could really learn by doing and keep iterating as new ideas and projects appeared.

The first goal was simple: a clear **portfolio** where someone could quickly understand who I am, what I study and what kind of projects I like to work on. From there, the site has grown into a small lab where I try things with accessibility, interactivity and visual storytelling.

## The first iteration

I was already working with React and Next.js when I started this website, so using them felt natural. It was definitely more than enough for a personal portfolio, but also the best excuse to practice components, routing and state in a real project that I actually care about.

Little by little I’ve been replacing static screenshots with more dynamic elements: small interactions, better layout for case studies and, in some places, custom visuals that connect more with the biomedical and accessibility topics I work on.

## Migrating and improving the stack

The site now runs on Next.js with static generation so that pages load fast and are easy to deploy. Styling is done with CSS Modules and some custom utilities, keeping things organised while still having freedom to design each section the way it needs.

For the content side, using MDX lets me mix markdown with React components. That way, case studies and articles can include richer pieces like custom callouts, code snippets or small interactive components without leaving the markdown flow.

On the visual side, I use tools like Three.js or 3D renders from Blender when it makes sense, especially to explain devices or interfaces in a more intuitive way than with flat images.

## Not all smooth sailing

Along the way there have been a few bumps: making transitions feel smooth, keeping animations accessible for people who prefer reduced motion, or avoiding layouts that break on smaller screens. Each of those issues has forced me to tidy up the structure of the project and think a bit more about how everything fits together.

Another recurring theme has been performance: balancing visuals, images and 3D content with reasonable loading times, especially on mobile, so the site feels responsive but still expressive.

## Looking back, and forward

Even though the site is still quite new, it has already changed several times as I add projects from university, personal prototypes and photography. The idea is to keep using it as a place to test things: new layouts for case studies, better ways to explain technical work, or small tools that could eventually help other people.

Over time, the goal is that each iteration makes the portfolio a bit clearer, a bit more accessible and a bit closer to the way I actually like to work: practical, collaborative and focused on building things that are useful for others.
