Hello everyone. I'm Alejandro Lopez Lamata and

00:03.093 --> 00:05.367
I am going to present my project entitled

00:05.367 --> 00:07.315
Retinitis pigmentosa support device

00:07.315 --> 00:07.640
Pigmentaria.

00:07.860 --> 00:09.801
Why did I decide to do this project?

00:09.801 --> 00:12.130
Well, to begin with, I wanted to here

00:12.130 --> 00:14.071
Let's put this quote from Louis

00:14.071 --> 00:15.624
Pastor Pasteur: Microbiologist and Chemist

00:15.624 --> 00:17.953
French, who says that we should be surprised by

00:17.953 --> 00:20.670
Something is the first step of

00:20.670 --> 00:22.611
mind towards discovery, making

00:22.611 --> 00:25.364
reference to that curiosity that we

00:25.364 --> 00:27.314
has brought everyone here today.

00:29.191 --> 00:31.792
The project started like this. In fact,

00:31.792 --> 00:34.393
Out of pure curiosity. There are many of us.

00:34.393 --> 00:36.994
those who in our day to

00:36.994 --> 00:39.595
Every day we live with people with some

00:39.595 --> 00:41.762
type of retinopathy or disability

00:41.762 --> 00:43.929
Visual. Not just retinitis pigmentosa anymore.

00:43.929 --> 00:45.989
pigmentary diseases, but other diseases such as

00:45.989 --> 00:48.324
They can be Stargard, Usher, or any other.

00:48.324 --> 00:51.292
Another one. So I always

00:51.292 --> 00:54.091
I've wondered if I really could

00:54.091 --> 00:56.890
try to contribute in some way to

00:56.890 --> 00:59.223
to help those people.

01:00.643 --> 01:03.321
could live their lives more

01:03.321 --> 01:05.998
Comfortable, right? Because they are also

01:05.998 --> 01:08.676
very rare diseases that do not

01:08.676 --> 01:11.397
They receive a lot of research. And

01:11.397 --> 01:13.595
when the opportunity presented itself to

01:13.595 --> 01:15.479
to be able to work with Carlos University

01:15.479 --> 01:17.363
Third, I decided to address this issue.
